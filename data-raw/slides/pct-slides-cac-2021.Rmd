# How the PCT works

---

## The first prototype of the PCT

- 1st prototype: Hackathon at ODI Leeds in February 2015

- We identifying key routes and mapped them

- For description of aims, see Lovelace et al. (2017)

<!-- ## Launched in 2017 -->

- Launched in 2017 with the Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy ([CWIS](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cycling-and-walking-investment-strategy))

## The PCT in 2021

- Now the go-to tool for strategic cycle network planning in England and Wales, used by most local authorities with cycling plans ([source](https://npct.github.io/pct-shiny/regions_www/www/static/03d_other_reports/2019-use-of-pct-report.pdf)).

## Geographic levels in the PCT

- Generate and analyse route networks for transport planning with reference to:
    - Zones
    - Origin-destination (OD) data
    - Geographic desire lines
    - Route allocation using different routing services
    - Route network generation and analysis

# Workshop 1

11:30 to 12:30

You will learn about the open datasets provided by the PCT project and how to use them.
While the most common use of the PCT is via the interactive web application hosted at www.pct.bike, there is much value in downloading the data, e.g. to identify existing cycling infrastructure in close proximity to routes with high potential, and to help identify roads in need of interventions from a safety perspective, using data from the constantly evolving and community-driven global geographic database OpenStreetMap (OSM).

In this session, which assumes you have experience using QGIS or R, you will learn how to:

-   Find data on travel behaviour from the 2011 Census and from the School Census
-   How to download and import data from the PCT into QGIS
-   How to process the data alongside infrastructure data, to help find gaps in the network

???

Preliminary timings:

Intro to the workshop and team and demo of the web app: 15 minutes

Working together: downloading PCT data and opening in QGIS (Section 1.2), plus demo of analysis(1.3 and 1.4): 15 minutes

Working together: downloading and opening the zip to see QGIS project (20 minutes 1.4 and 1.5)

Discussion of definition of cycle infrastructure (Joey 5 minutes, 1.5)

Discussion of schools data and merging school and commute route networks (Nathanael 5 minutes)

# Workshop 2

See Section 2 of [itsleeds.github.io/pct/articles/getting.html](https://itsleeds.github.io/pct/articles/getting.html#modelling-change)

Designed for people with experience with the PCT and cycling uptake estimates who want to learn more about how uptake models work and how to generate new scenarios of change.
Reproducible and open R code will be used to demonstrate the concepts so knowledge of R or other programming languages is recommended but not essential, as there will be conceptual exercises covering the factors linked to mode shift.
In it you will:

-   Learn about the uptake model underlying the Propensity to Cycle Tool scenarios
-   Develop your own uptake model in conceptual terms, e.g., to represent the [government's aim](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/transport-decarbonisation-plan) for 50% of all trips in towns and cities to be made by walking and cycling by 2030
-   Learn how to train uptake models against data, to build evidence-based uptake models

# Uses of the PCT

- Visioning
- Planning strategic cycle networks
- Identifying corridors with high latent demand

Uses that were not initially planned

- Pop-up cycleway planning
- LTN planning?

## Deploying in new contexts

- Requires survey based or synthetic OD data, to be processed by software developed at Leeds `r Citep(my_bib, "lovelace_stplanr:_2018", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`
- For mor on methods, see the [transport chapter](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/transport.html) (available free [online](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/)) `r Citep(my_bib, "lovelace_geocomputation_2019", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))` 
- Can also be used for specific contexts (e.g. cycling to school, cycling to public transport) `r Citep(my_bib, "goodman_scenarios_2019", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`

## Estimating health benefits of cycling uptake with the PCT

- The PCT uses a modified version of the HEAT methodology to calculate health benefits of scenarios of change
- Based on the DfT's TAG methodology
- The scenarios are **what if** scenarios not forecasts 
- See the PCT manual for further information: [pct.bike/manual.html](https://npct.github.io/pct-shiny/regions_www/www/static/03a_manual/pct-bike-eng-user-manual-c1.pdf)
- See the DfT's [AMAT tool](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/888754/amat-user-guidance.pdf) also

<!-- ## Transport planning software -->

<!-- Transport modelling software products are a vital component of modern transport planning *and* research. -->

<!-- - They generate the evidence base on which strategic investments are made and, furthermore, -->
<!-- - provide a powerful mechanism for researching alternative futures. -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- It would not be an overstatement to say that software determines the range of futures that are visible to policymakers. This makes status of transport modelling software and how it may evolve in the future important questions. -->

<!-- What will transport software look like? What will their capabilities be? And who will control? Answers to each of these questions will affect the future of transport systems.  -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- - Premise: transport planning/modelling software used in practice ~~will become~~ is becoming increasingly data-driven, modular and open.  -->

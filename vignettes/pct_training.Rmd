# Introduction

This vignette supports workshops on advanced usage and development of the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT).
Beginner and intermediate PCT events focus on using the PCT via the web application hosted at [www.pct.bike](http://www.pct.bike/) and the data provided by the PCT in [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/).

The focus here is on analysing cycling potential in the open source statistical programming language R, in which the majority of the PCT was built.
It will show how the code underlying the PCT works, how the underlying data can be accessed using R for reproducible analysis, and how the methods can be used to generate new scenarios of cycling uptake.

There will be 2 courses:

- In London on **Friday 21st June** 
- In Leeds on **Friday 2nd August (TBC)** 

# Prerequisites

This is an advanced training course with specific pre-requisites.
Please only register if you:

- Have experience analysing geographic area and route data of the type used in the PCT
- Have experience using software for geographic data, including working knowledge of the statistical programming language R
- Can bring a laptop that has up-to-date versions of R, RStudio and the necessary R packages installed (see next section)

In addition, if you want to do routing on your computer: 

- Register for a CycleStreets.net API key from: https://www.cyclestreets.net/api/

If you are new to R this course may not be appropriate for you.
If you are an intermediate user, it may be worth brushing-up on your R skills, e.g. by taking a free online course such as that provided by [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) or by working through [Chapter 2 onwards of the open source book *Geocomputation with R*](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-class.html) (see reading list below for more transport-specific resources).

## Prior reading

In addition to computer hardware (a laptop) and software (an up-to-date R set-up and experience using R) pre-requisites, you should have read, or at least have working knowledge of the contents of, the following publications, all of which are freely available online:

- The original paper on the Propensity to Cycle Tool [@lovelace_propensity_2017]
- The transport chapter ([12](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/transport.html)) in the open source book [*Geocomputation with R*](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/)  [@lovelace_geocomputation_2019]
- The vignette that describes the pct R package, which can be found here: https://itsleeds.github.io/pct/articles/pct.html

## R packages

**To ensure your computer is ready for the course, please test that you can run the following lines of R code on your computer, resulting in the map shown below:**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
pkgs = c(
  "cyclestreets",
  "mapview",
  "pct",
  "sf",
  "stats19",
  "stplanr",
  "tidyverse",
  "devtools"
)
remotes::install_cran(pkgs)
# remotes::install_github("ITSLeeds/pct")
```

## Test code

To test your computer is ready to work with PCT data in R, try running the following commands.
It should result in the map below showing the % of short trips in West Yorkshire made by active modes.


```{r setup, out.width="100%", message=FALSE}
library(pct)
library(dplyr)   # in the tidyverse
library(leaflet) # installed alongside mapvew
zones_all = get_pct_zones("west-yorkshire")
lines_all = get_pct_lines("west-yorkshire")
# basic plot
plot(zones_all$geometry)
plot(lines_all$geometry[lines_all$all > 500], col = "red", add = TRUE)
# interactive plot
active = lines_all %>% 
  mutate(`Percent Active` = (bicycle + foot) / all * 100) %>% 
  filter(e_dist_km < 5)
pal = colorBin(palette = "RdYlBu", domain = active$`Percent Active`, bins = c(0, 2, 4, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 90))
leaflet(data = active) %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$OpenStreetMap.BlackAndWhite) %>% 
  addPolylines(color = ~pal(`Percent Active`), weight = active$all / 100) %>% 
  addLegend(pal = pal, values = ~`Percent Active`)
```

We can also use the data to explore entrenched car dependence, as follows:

```{r, out.width="100%"}
# car dependent desire lines
car_dependent = lines_all %>% 
  mutate(`Percent Drive` = (car_driver) / all * 100) %>% 
  filter(e_dist_km < 5)
pal = colorBin(palette = "RdYlBu", domain = car_dependent$`Percent Active`, bins = c(0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100), reverse = TRUE)
leaflet(data = car_dependent) %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$OpenStreetMap.BlackAndWhite) %>% 
  addPolylines(color = ~pal(`Percent Drive`), weight = active$all / 100) %>% 
  addLegend(pal = pal, values = ~`Percent Drive`)
```

# Exercises

## How the PCT works and what you can use it for

- Take a look at the image below. Which parts of the process are of most use for your work?

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npct/pct-team/master/flow-model/flow-diag2.png)

- In groups of 2, identify 3 real world questions/problems that you could use the PCT to help answer/solve

<!-- Communicating a vision -->
<!-- Deciding on network scale/size/shape -->
<!-- Generating business case for investment -->
<!-- Feed into consulation -->
<!-- Extend it to look at cycling integraton -->

The PCT provides data at 4 geographic levels:

- Zones
- Desire lines
- Routes
- Route networks

Which types of data are most appropriate to tackle each of the questions/problems you identified?

- Name 3 limitations of the data currently provided by the PCT and discuss how you could overcome them

<!-- OD data is old -> use new OD data -->
<!-- Only single stage journeys -> Model travel to rail, for example -->
<!-- It does not predict future levels of cycling following new infrastructure -> -->
<!--   Wait until follow-on work building CyIPT is developed -->

## Getting and viewing PCT data

Using the online interface, identify the MSOA **zone** that has the highest number of people who cycle to work.

Using data downloaded with the command `get_pct_zones()`, identify the zone that has highest level of cycling with the function `top_n()` and save the result as an object called `z_highest_cycling` (hint: you may want to start by 'cleaning' the data you have downloaded to include only a few key columns with the function `select()`, as follows):

```{r}
library(pct)
library(tidyverse)
z_original = get_pct_zones("isle-of-wight")
z = z_original %>% 
  select(geo_code, geo_name, all, bicycle, car_driver)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# the solution:
# View(z)
z_highest_cycling = z %>% 
  top_n(n = 1, wt = bicycle)
```

Use the `plot()` command to visualise where on the Ilse of Wight this 'high cycling' zone is (hint: you will need to use the `plot()` function twice, once to plot `z$geometry`, and again with the argument `add = TURE` and a `col` argument to add the layer on top of the base layer and give it a colour).
The result should look like something this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(z$geometry)
plot(z_highest_cycling$geometry, col = "red", add = TRUE)
```



Using the online interface, identify the MSOA to MSOA **desire line** that has the highest number of people who cycle to work.

Using data downloaded with the command `get_pct_lines()`, identify the zone that has highest level of cycling.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
l_original = get_pct_lines("isle-of-wight")
l = l_original %>% 
  select(geo_code1, geo_code2, all, bicycle, car_driver)
View(l)
l %>% 
  top_n(n = 1, wt = bicycle)
```

## 

## Accessing data


## Scenarios of change


## Routing


## Route networks

## Ideas for training

- Identify quiet routes and design a quiet route network for Westminter

<!-- - Design interventions to replace short car trips across London (or another region of your choice) using the PCT methods/data to support your decisions -->
<!-- - Identify priority routes to improve for bike share users by using OD data from TfL's bike share (if we get time to do this) -->

<!-- Demonstrate routing with cyclestreets.net -->
